# python-challenge

Module 3 Challenge; Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.

For this challenge I utilized the ASKBCS feature on Slack, Google, ChatGPT, fellow students, Stack Overflow, TA assistance, Bootcamp tutor assistance, and educcational resources related to the python unit provided by the bootcamp.

Code utilized for this challenge can be found in the files titled "main.py" within the PyBank and PyPoll directories on my github "python-challenge" repo.

Please reach out if you have any questions, thank you for your time.
